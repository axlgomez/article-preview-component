# Article preview component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

## The project 

In this project I built this **article preview component**.

You should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
    * addEventListener()
    * getElementById()
    * arrow functions
